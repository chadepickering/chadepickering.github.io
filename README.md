Welcome! I'm Chad Pickering, a biostatistics graduate student at UCLA graduating in spring 2019. 
I am seeking full-time employment in the Bay Area in the intersection of data science and biostatistics 
in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries. 

The following are a selection of the projects I have submitted in graduate school at UCLA 
and as an undergraduate at UC Davis, where I received a B.S. in statistics with a minor in computer science.
